# snowball_game

Created a 2-D Legend of Zelda-inspired game using the PyGame library for educational purposes. Learned a lot while making this project, such as reinforcing OOP principles, inheritance, directed self-learning, working through unfamiliar libaries and their documentation.

Most of the structure of the code is from a tutorial from the Youtube channel Clear Code, with a link and credit below

Added the following additional functionality on my own, not from the source video.
* Created a drag-and-release shooting mechanic with projectile logic
* Added a weapon select option with weapon-select UI in the bottom left corner
* Included my three dogs as weapon options, with corresponding self-made pixel art

Hope to add the following eventually
* Make my own map using Tiled software
* Make enemies drop loot
* Welcome screen with stage select
